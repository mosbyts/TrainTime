## Description
TrainTime is a live train tracker based on information the user input.

## Motivation
This tool was created as part of the University of Richmond Full Stack Flex Web Development program curriculum to further JavaScript, API and ajax skills as well as introduce us to momentJS. It is useful for those who want to insert their own train times and track how often the train will come and at what time.

## Tech Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

This tool was created using a simple HTML and CSS file then linking an additional JavaScript file. It also uses a Firebase Database to hold the information.
